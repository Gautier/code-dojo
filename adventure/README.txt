Adventure Game Code Dojo
========================

What: An extended dojo problem with elements that can be solved over several
weeks (building upon work done in previous dojos).

Why: A classic text-based adventure game contains lots of opportunity to
practice and experience different aspects of comp-sci / programming.

* Build and navigate a game world (week 1 - directed graph?)
* Represent and facilitate in-game objects / puzzles (e.g. "kill Grue with sword")
* Build a parser for interpreting players commands
* Represent, control and validate game state
* NPC AI / NLP (NPC = Non-player characters, NLP = natural language processing)
* Client/Server/Multi-user support (a la MUD/MOO - perhaps using Twisted?)
* Make a UI to display images and other multi-media
