The results of a group based dojo to add objects and state to the adventure
game.

At the end of the task team 1's efforts were deemed to have advanced most so
the group "blessed" it as the cannonical version we'd use in the next dojo.

To run the game type:

python adventure.py data.txt

I'll also add the solutions from other teams into appropriately named
sub-folders as and when I get the code / pull requests. So far I only have
team 5 with their additional "monster" feature ;-)

The data.txt file was created by a separate team of "creatives"
