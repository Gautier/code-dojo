Creating a social graph using the twitter API
=============================================

Aim: 
===

To bridge Twitter and Graphviz to produce pretty directed graphs of social
networks.

Requirements:
============

Graphviz - http://www.graphviz.org/ (for creating the output)
Python - http://python.org/ (the language of choice)
NoseTests - http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/ (for running the
test suite)
ptt (Python Twitter Tools) - http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/ (Twitter API in
Python)

Setup:
=====

Please refer to the documentation for Graphviz and Python for installation
according to your operating system.

For ptt, assuming you have Python's setuptools installed (if not the see:
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools) just type:

easy_install twitter

For nose just type:

easy_install nose

That's it!

Usage:
=====

I've created two files as a starting point:

* dojo.py - imports the appropriate stuff and includes two utility functions:

    1) create_dot_file - to generate the social graph in Graphviz's dot language
    2) create_graph_file - to output the results from Graphviz

* test_dojo.py - the start of a test suite. You should add your tests here!

Problems to Solve:
=================

* Given a username, get the user's twitter followers
* Given a username, discover who they are following
* Given a user ID grab the user information
* Build a graph showing followers of a start user
* Update the existing code to prettify the resulting graph (show username,
fullname and last tweet [with date] for example)
* Build a graph showing the followers of a start user that also shows followers
who follow each other
* Build a graph of depth n showing who follows who given a certain start user
* Add a constraint / algorithm for limiting the "breadth" of the graph (for
users with many followers) 
* Find a means of weighing a user's "importance" (e.g. number of followers / 
number of friends) and showing this on the graph (what other ways of showing
"importance" could be used?)
